Commands:

ls - list command for Linux shell (dir-windows)

ls -l  for detail list with description -rwx read write execute 
	Q. how to detail of each file
	user group public global access

ls -a for hidden files

ls -a -l hidden detail file

.sh files in green
directory blue
files txt for white

perform list of all files in ascending order of files with alphabetical(size)
sorting ls -S list | ls -s alphabetical order total count
capital S -S sorts and view on basis of size Max to Min 
lowercase s -s in a-z manner also gives count of files
-l details with all info
-a hidden files
YOU CAN MAKE COMBINATION OF VARIOUS COMMANDS

ls -lt Sorted order of Modified time

for help:
Q Maximum detailed info by which command will give you detailed about the command
info <command>  briefly about the command	DETAILED INFO
man <command> if you want to see manual of any command 
<command> --help lit version of man 

FILE HANDLING:
	server create log file 
MAKE FILE
touch myfile.txt creates a blank file with myfile.txt or change the timestamp
if file exist it will update the timestamp

touch: creates blank/empty file
	if already exists then update the time stamp of last access
	you can add multiple files by creating spaces

Cloud distributed data

Q What is difference between duplicate & replicate data?
Replicate & duplicate is making exact copy but in replication we maintain consistency with original data, 
(databases---blockchain---replicated always)
majority-update
duplicate nothing as such done.

COPY FILE
cp file1 file2 oldfile -> newfile
Q how will you copy entire directory

cp copy file
cp <source file> <destination file> #file
cp -r <directory_source> <directory)dest>
-r recursive call	

mv to move file from one to other location
mv <file> <location>
mv <old_filename> <new_filename>#rename it is used to rename file
Q How to rename the file in linux


local path
/sub dir/file

absolute path
./sub/sub/file
.:home dir

mkdir make directory

Q List all text file in dir
ls *.txt

Q list all the text file in descending order of their size
ls -l -S *.txt

Q Most recently sh file
ls -lt *.sh

Q 
ls -S -lt *.sh

--------------------------------------

wc word and line count
wc -l file.txt -- line
wc -w file.txt --- words

Q Extra space given in the file will it count the word?
No
character count in bytes

How to read data from file------------------------
head filename 			by default will run only 10 file
head -n <count> filename

similarly for tail
tail filename

.dat is the extension		

how to add 2 commands on single line by using && 

head -n 2 file1.dat && tail -n 2 file1.dat

&& will combine output of 2 file************************************


Part of area/data
first 7 nikalo last 3 lin read from 7 line read 3 line
head -n 7 file1.txt | tail -n 3

head -n 7 file1.dat || tail -n 3 file1.dat

if you want to skip 
tail -n +3 first1.dat


cat -> Display content of file on terminal 
cat > name_of_file it will allow to add new file 
	it overrides not append
cat > name_of_file  creates file and adds given data, if file already there will overwrite

cat >> name_of_file  creates file and adds given data, if file already there will append new data at the end 

cat file_1 file_2> file_to_write: Combines file 1, 2 to newly created file

cat >> info.txt	append in the file

CONTENT OF THE FILE	
grep: general matching regular expressions pattern matching
	searching data on basis of RE/Pattern generally for sorting

Regular Expresssions

grep 'string' file  

grep -i 'string' file searches without case sensitivity 

pattern to work with we have ^\

grep -v "string" file --= line that is not having given string

grep -n "string" file gives line number :

grep 'is' testfile.txt

grep 'this' testfile.txt.dat | wc-l
grep 'this' testfile.txt | wc-w

grep 'data' testfile.dat


nano searching.sh

look for the file_create.sh

read -p "Enter ur mesg:" user_

Q 
nishkil for objective c


VVIMP *********************************
TIME AND DATE(Max questions)
date will print the current time and date
we need to create format + to print year date time etc
see for date --help

date -d 'next week' '+%d/%m/%Y' for next week
$ echo date

Q generate a file with the current date and time in the fiel


line by line
less <file>: give data page by page ---used with large file
large file page by page

less +F <line number> File

less +F  10 file1.dat

less -l 'search_data' file


-------------------------------AFTER BREAK---------------------------------------
